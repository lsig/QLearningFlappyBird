# Q-Learning and Deep-Q-Learning for FlappyBird
This repository contains two different machine learning models for learning flappy bird. 
## Q-Learning 
There are two different Q-Learning classes, one simple with a fixed learning rate and a fixed epsilon. The other class implements 
learning rate decay and epsilon decay for greater configuration. Surprisingly Q-Learning beats out the Deep-Q-Learning neural network. 
## Deep-Q-Learning 
The Deep-Q-Learning class is extremely configurable and easy to finetune for different needs. The network architecture is isolated in the network 
script, and tuning the hyperparameters is done the deep_q_learning script. 
## Report
For greater detail you can find a pdf report in the repository which explains the project and its results.

Happy Flapping!
